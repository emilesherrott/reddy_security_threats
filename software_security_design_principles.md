# 1. Principle of Least Privilege:

- Users or processes should only have the minimum permissions needed for their tasks to limit potential damage if there's unauthorized access.
- To prevent data leaks, apply least privilege in the app and control plan.
- Use DevSecOps for automation and reduce the need for human involvement.

# 2. Principle of Defense in Depth:

- Also called layered security, this principle suggests using multiple security measures to protect a system.
- If one layer is breached, others remain to discourage attackers.

# 3. Principle of Economy of Mechanism:

- Keep designs simple for easier testing and better security.
- Complex systems have more potential vulnerabilities.

# 4. Principle of Complete Mediation:

- Authenticate and authorize every access request.
- Regular validation helps prevent unauthorized access.

# 5. Principle of Open Design:

- Security shouldn't rely on keeping the design secret.
- Transparency allows broader scrutiny, helping identify potential flaws.

# 6. Principle of Separation of Privilege:

- Don't grant permissions based on a single condition.
- Require multiple conditions for enhanced security.

# 7. Principle of Least Common Mechanism:

- Minimize shared mechanisms or resources to reduce the potential attack surface.

# 8. Principle of Psychological Acceptability:

- Security measures should not make the system harder to use.
- User-friendly security encourages compliance and reduces the temptation to bypass security features.

# 9. Principle of Weakest Link:

- A system is only as secure as its weakest link.
- Consider security holistically, focusing on all parts, even minor or less critical ones.

# 10. Principle of Weakest Link

- A system is only as secure as its weakest link. This principle highlights the need for holistic security consideration, focusing equally on all parts, even those considered minor or less critical.
